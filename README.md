- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: I can blow spit bubbles. 😂

I’m a developer who specializes in code structure, clarity, and architectural thinking.
I care deeply about building modular, scalable, and maintainable systems.
My strength lies in finding the best overall solution, not just the quickest one. 
I love breaking down complex problems, guiding others through clean design, and thinking
ahead to bonus-level scalability from the very first line of code.
I'm working toward roles in software architecture, technical leadership, and code quality advocacy.
